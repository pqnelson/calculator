# Overview

This is a simple library consisting of scheme code to compute elementary functions.

The installation is simple, just load it. There are no dependencies.

It's coded for the MIT-Scheme, so some of it might not be platform independent (mostly the `infinite?` and `:+inf.*` functions might cause problems).
